EXTRACT
=======

The EXTRACT phase consists of the following steps:

* extraction and cleaning of the ecoinvent database
* import and cleaning of additional inventories
* import and cleaning of user-provided inventories (optional)
* loading of IAM data

Supported versions of ecoinvent
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

*premise* currently works with the following ecoinvent database versions:

* v.3.5, cut-off
* v.3.6, cut-off
* v.3.7, cut-off
* v.3.71., cut-off
* v.3.8, cut-off

Work is being carried out to develop compatibility with the *consequential*
version of the ecoinvent database.

Supported sources of ecoinvent
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

*premise* can extract the ecoinvent database from:

* a brightway2 project that contains the ecoinvent database
* ecosposld2 files, that can be downloaded from the ecoinvent_ website

.. _ecoinvent: https://ecoinvent.org



From a brightway2 project
-------------------------

To extract from an ecoinvent database located in a brightway2 project, simply
indicate the database name in `source_db` and its version in `source_version`:

.. code-block:: python

  from premise import *
  import brightway2 as bw

  bw.projects.set_current("my_project)

  ndb = NewDatabase(
        scenarios=[
                {"model":"remind", "pathway":"SSP2-Base", "year":2028}
            ],
        source_db="ecoinvent 3.7 cutoff", # <-- this is NEW.
        source_version="3.7.1", # <-- this is NEW
        key='xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx'
    )

Note that a cache of the database will be created the first time and
store in the library folder. Any subsequent creation of databases
using the same ecoinvent version will no longer require this extraction
step.

If you wish to clear that cache folder, do:

.. code-block:: python

    from premise import *

    clear_cache()

From ecospold2 files
--------------------

To extract from a set of ecospold2 files, you need to point to the location of those files
in `source_file_path`, as well as indicate the database format in `source_type`:

.. code-block:: python

    from premise import *

    ndb = NewDatabase(
        scenarios = [
            {"model":"remind", "pathway":"SSP2-Base", "year":2028}
                    ],
        source_type="ecospold", # <--- this is NEW
        source_file_path=r"C:\file\path\to\ecoinvent 3.5_cutoff_ecoSpold02\datasets", # <-- this is NEW
        source_version="3.5",
    )

Import of additional inventories
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

After the ecoinvent database is extracted and checked, a number of additional invenotries
are imported, regardless of the year of scenario that is being considered.


Power generation
----------------

A number of  datasets relating to power generation not originally present in
ecoinvent are imported. The next sub-sections lists such datasets.

Power plants with CCS
*********************

Datasets for power generation with Carbon Capture and Storage are imported.
They originate from Volkart et al. 2013_, and can be consulted here: LCI_Power_generation_.

.. _2013: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijggc.2013.03.003

The table below lists the names of the new activities (only production datasets are shown).

Natural gas
***********

Updated inventories relating to natural gas extraction and distribution
are imported to substitute some of the original ecoinvent dataset.
These datasets originate from ESU Services and come with a report_,
and can be consulted here: LCI_Oil_NG_.

.. _LCI_Oil_NG: https://github.com/romainsacchi/premise/blob/master/premise/data/additional_inventories/lci-ESU-oil-and-gas.xlsx

They have been adapted to a brightway2-compatible format.
These new inventories have, among other things, higher methane slip
emissions along teh natural gas supply chain, especially at extraction.

.. _report: http://www.esu-services.ch/fileadmin/download/publicLCI/meili-2021-LCI%20for%20the%20oil%20and%20gas%20extraction.pdf

 ========================================================== ==============================================================

The original natural gas datasets are preserved, but they do not provide input to any
other datasets in the database. The new datasets provide natural gas at high pressure to
the original supply chains, which remain unchanged.

The table below lists the names of the new activities.
