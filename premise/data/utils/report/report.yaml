Electricity - generation:
  label: Exajoules (EJ)
  expl_text: Generated volumes of electricity, per technology. Used to calculate the electricty supply mix. All technologies supply at high voltage except Residential PV.
Electricity (biom) - generation:
  label: Exajoules (EJ)
  expl_text: Volumes of biomass used to generate electrical power (biomass-based CHP, biomass-based IGCC, etc.). Used to calculate supply mix of biomass used as fuel.
Electricity - efficiency:
  label: Efficiency gains (2020 = 1)
  expl_text: Energy efficiency gains per (combustion-based) technology relative to 2020. Used to calibrate the efficiency of the electricity-producing datasets. The efficiency of renewables is calibrated separately.
